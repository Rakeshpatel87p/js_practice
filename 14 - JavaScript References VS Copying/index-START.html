    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    players.splice(); //how to make a copy. 
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const play5 = [].concat(players)
    
    play5.push('Russ Goldstein');
    console.log(play5);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const play2 = [...players];
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //Only goes 1 level deep
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100});

    console.log(person)
    console.log(cap2)

    const cap3 = {...person, age: 52}

    console.log(cap3)

    const wes = {
      age: 52,
      number: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: 'coolman', //Object.assign will not go this deep
        fb: 'holler'
      }
    }
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    //Poor mans deep clone
    console.log(`check out poor man's deep clonse ${JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))}`)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
